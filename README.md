## Description

_In this game, the user chooses what size grid they'd like to play on and how many mines to play with. User clicks on each square of the grid, revealing either a mine or a number indicating how many mines are within the 8 squares around the clicked square. If user clicks on a mine, they lose the game. User can flag mines by right-clicking their mouse. Once all non-mine squares have been uncovered, the user wins._
